# Cryptocurrency News Sentiment Analysis with Transformer Models

## üéØ Project Goals
This project aims to analyze cryptocurrency market sentiment through news articles using state-of-the-art transformer models. The main objectives include:

- **Accurate Sentiment Classification**: Classifying cryptocurrency news into Positive, Negative, or Neutral sentiment categories.
- **Multilingual Analysis**: Translating Turkish cryptocurrency news into English for a broader analysis.
- **Model Performance Comparison**: Evaluating and comparing the performance of various transformer models.
- **Robust Sentiment Analysis Pipeline**: Building a reusable and scalable sentiment analysis framework.

## üîÑ Workflow

### **1. Data Collection & Preparation**
- Gathered cryptocurrency news articles from various sources.
- Cleaned and preprocessed text data, including tokenization, stemming, and lemmatization.
- Translated Turkish news articles to English for multilingual analysis.
- Created balanced datasets by generating synthetic data using GPT for class imbalance correction.

### **2. Model Implementation**
Six different transformer models were implemented and fine-tuned:
- **BERT**: Used as a baseline model for comparison.
- **ALBERT**: Lightweight and optimized alternative to BERT.
- **DeBERTa**: Focused on enhanced attention mechanisms.
- **DistilBERT**: A faster and more compressed version of BERT.
- **FinBERT**: Designed specifically for financial text analysis.
- **GPT**: Used for generative sentiment analysis and synthetic data generation.

### **3. Analysis Process**
- Each model was trained on the prepared dataset.
- Sentiment classification was performed across three classes: Positive, Negative, Neutral.
- Evaluated performance using metrics such as:
  - Accuracy
  - Precision
  - Recall
  - F1 Score
